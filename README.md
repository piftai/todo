Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. 
I decided to write this app because: i did not know about you can put your command in $PATH and run it like usual command from bash: like pwd, ls, cd andother stuff. The second one reason is that i want to fill my github some projects in Go. 

Also i want fill this readme file to you understand how this app works.

USAGE:

[add] - add a task ./main add <description>

[list] - show a list of all tasks ./main list

[update] - update task by id ./main update <id> <new description>
